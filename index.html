        <P><h5> mother is not just my parent; she is my role model, my teacher, and my source of inspiration.</h5></P>
        <p>A role model is someone who inspires and motivates us to strive for greatness and become better individuals. For me, that person is my mother. She is the epitome of strength, compassion, and resilience, and has always been my guiding light. Through her actions, values, and love, she has shaped me into the person I am today</p>
